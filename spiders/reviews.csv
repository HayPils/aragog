5.0 out of 5 stars,"WOW!  I'd always held off spending $35 on a furminator brush.  When I saw this one at 1/3 the price, I thought ""why not?""  After all, who doesn't spend hundreds or thousands of dollars a year on their dog!  I had NO idea my dog was so hairy!  Of course, the fact my Dyson fills up every week should be a hint.  This brush is fantastic, AND, my dog likes to be brushed by it!  She HATES the other brush I use.  So I've brushed her with this brush twice a day, in the morning and evening, about 10 minutes per time, for 4 days now.  While my neighborhood is filled with ""tumbleweeds"" of corgi hair blowing around, my dog is shiny, slick looking, AND visibly thinner.  After 4 days (80 minutes of brushing in total) almost no more hair comes out!  I cannot live without this de-shedding tool!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,I was skeptical about this brush because of the price difference between this and the Furminator but this brush works great! I have a Husky and her hair is been a problem since we got her. After 20 minutes of brushing her I pulled off a ton of fur and it all came out from her undercoat. Highly recommend this brush!
4.0 out of 5 stars,"So far, so good. I have two short coat golden retrievers, one with a thick coat, one with a normal coat. This brush worked well on both of them! It pulled so much hair out of my blonde that I felt like I needed to stop! After reading reviews about it creating bald spots, I didn't want to brush either of them too long. Overall, this seems like a good brush.Update:Tried this brush on a German Shorthair Pointer, he has extremely short smooth hair. There is honestly no brush that works on him. This one seemed to pull a little bit of hair out, but nothing substantial. This did work well on the GSP/Black Mouth Cur mix though. Her hair is similar to a labs coat. Overall, it worked decent on all hair types!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a lab / golden retreiver mix dog who sheds like crazy. I previously had the yellow famous brand deshedding tool, which worked wonderfully, but somehow I misplaced it.  Those suckers are expensive, so when I finally went to buy a replacement, I was happy to see this brand for much, much cheaper. Amazon has an awesome return policy, so I thought I'd give it a shot and see if it worked the same. This tool works every bit as well as the expensive one that costs way more. The teeth are exactly the same, and the undercoat comes out easily, just like with the other brand. I love it!  It's amazing how much loose fur this thing gets out."
5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have a 5 month old GSD/husky pup that has begun loosing his puppy coat. I've been vacuuming every day, so I knew it was time to get a new brush! I've been grooming him with  a regular paddle brush daily, getting a small handful of hair, but this tool takes the cake!This picture shows all the fur that came off in a ten minute session, and I honestly could've kept going! So glad I tried this before paying three times as much for a real furminator!To address some of the negative reviews: I ran the brush gently along my forearms several times and did not have scratches or irritation. This type of tool is meant to be used with light pressure, and it will still get the job done! My pup doesn't usually like being brushed with the wire paddle brush we had, but he actually seemed to like this one! Time will tell how it has up, but for now two big paws up!"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"UPDATE:Almost two years later, we're still using the same two combs every couple days now that we're back in the ""blow out the summer coat"" Fall season.  A spring leapt out of one of the two of these, I 3D printed a little block to grab and hold the comb in the handle.  Other than that?  Works just like the first day.UPDATE:I like providing long-term reviews.7 months later, the second one still remains new in the package.  We use the first one almost every night, especially on the broken coat boy and particularly this time of year.  He's come to tolerate it for about ten minutes which is enough time to get up most of what wants to come up.Overall, seven months later, couldn't be happier with this stripping comb!-------I have two Jack Russell Terriers, brother and sister, but one is a rough coat, and the other broken.The broken coat and rough coats are not like the smooth coats I've had in the past - they have a lot of trouble blowing out their thick undercoat by themselves.  I card them this time of year, then spend an hour each hand stripping almost every day.  They HATE being stripped.The package arrived, I tore it open, and said: ""ok!  Who's the first victim?"" - Yin is faster than her brother Yang, and she made it out the door... Yang, the broken coat, was first.  I carded him for about ten minutes with the carding brush until nothing more would come up, then started in with this ""deshedding tool"".  Now, we've tried stripping knives in the past, and the twins just will NOT tolerate them.  Instantly tremendous amounts of hair started coming out, immediately clogging the tool.  I cleaned it, and started in again, always following the grain of the hair.  He actually laid down on my lap, closed his eyes, and was soon _snooring_!  It took about fifteen minutes, but at the end, we had an eight inch ball of soft undercoat, and I've never seen him look better!  See the attached photo.I'm going to buy a second one just to have it on hand for when this one dulls!I've seen the negative reviews here, and thought it was a little sketchy, but honestly:  for my broken coat JRT - it's a miracle.  (Now if I can catch Yin, we'll see how it does with a rough coat)"
5.0 out of 5 stars,"Almost purchased a similar, popular branded brush for way more, but decided to give this a shot first. I have not tried the other brand so I can not compare the effectiveness of each, but I am satisfied with my purchase. The brush is sturdy, easy to use, and comes with a plastic cover to slide over the prongs of the comb when not in use. The hair is easy to remove from the comb and the comb does not seem to pull the hair to harshly or scratch my dog's skin any more than a regular comb. My dog lets me brush him and seems to enjoy it. About 3-5 mins of brushing releases a decent size ball of hair once it's all said and done, and I've noticed less hair on the carpet and furniture. He still sheds, but just doing this once a week has reduced the amount of hair I have to vacuum daily. Would recommend this before trying a more expensive brand."
5.0 out of 5 stars,I have a Siamese Ragdoll cat so he sheds A LOT. I was looking for something that was similar to the furmenator because I heard so many good things about it besides the price. I looked around this seemed to have the best ratings. Now I know why! I only brushed my cat for a couple minutes tonight and it worked just like I thought it would. He also didn't mind being brushed by it either :) Very pleased!
